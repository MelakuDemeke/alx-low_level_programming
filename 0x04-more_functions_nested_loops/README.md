- [1. isdigit](./1-isdigit.c) :Write a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`).
- [2. Collaboration is multiplication](./2-mul.c) : Write a function that multiplies two integers.
- [3. The numbers speak for themselves](./3-print_numbers.c) : Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
- [4. I believe in numbers and signs](./4-print_most_numbers.c) :  Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line.
- [5 Numbers constitute the only universal language](./5-more_numbers.c) : Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line.
